1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for the initial website of [Your Company Name], an AI platform designed for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The website will serve as the primary marketing and sales tool for Phase 1, aiming to attract SMB owners, educate them on AI benefits, and convert them into consultation leads. It includes six core pages: Home, How It Works, Solutions, Why Us, About, and Pricing, each with specific sections, design considerations, functionality, and success metrics. The design uses a simple black-and-white color scheme inspired by Notion's clean aesthetic, with royal blue as the main accent color, aligning with the user's request. The Home page layout is inspired by Salesforce's effective B2B SaaS structure, with a prominent CTA and email capture form above the fold, followed by a "How It Works" video below the fold.

**NOTE: ALL COMPONENTS WILL BE BUILT FROM SCRATCH. No external component libraries or frameworks will be used for any UI elements. Every button, form, card, navigation item, and other interface elements will be custom-built to ensure complete control over the design and functionality.**

**IMPORTANT DESIGN STANDARD: This website must reflect a modern, high-tech fast-growing company, NOT an MVP. All UI components and visuals must be professionally designed, highly polished, and reflect the quality of established industry leaders. The finished product should convey innovation, reliability, and premium quality through its visual execution.**

2. Goals
Generate Leads: Capture SMB owner contact information for follow-up.
Educate Visitors: Simplify AI concepts and highlight practical benefits for SMBs.
Build Trust: Establish [Your Company Name] as a credible, approachable AI partner.
Drive Bookings: Encourage free consultation bookings via Calendly.
Communicate Value: Present a transparent, flexible pricing model that reassures visitors.
3. Target Audience
Primary Users: SMB owners and decision-makers (10-500 employees).
Industries: Retail, Hospitality, Professional Services, Manufacturing (initial focus).
Tech Savviness: Varies; many lack AI expertise and seek easy, business-focused solutions.
Pain Points: Manual task overload, limited tech skills, need for efficiency, growth, and affordability.
4. Color Scheme and Design Principles
The website adopts a simple black-and-white color scheme with royal blue as the main accent color, inspired by Notion's minimalist design and adapted from Salesforce's effective use of blue accents. This ensures a clean, professional, and trustworthy look that resonates with SMB owners.

Primary Colors:
Black (#000000): Used for headlines, body text, and navigation links.
White (#FFFFFF): Background color for all pages and sections.
Accent Color:
Royal Blue (#0057D9): Used for CTAs, buttons, icons, borders, and key interactive elements.
Secondary Colors:
Light Gray (#F5F5F5): For subtle backgrounds or dividers (e.g., footer).
Dark Gray (#333333): For secondary text or less prominent elements.

Design Principles:
Minimalism: Avoid unnecessary colors or elements to maintain focus, mirroring Notion's clean aesthetic.
Contrast: Ensure high contrast between text and backgrounds for readability (black text on white).
Consistency: Use royal blue consistently for all CTAs and interactive elements, inspired by Salesforce's effective accent usage.
Whitespace: Leverage ample spacing to create an uncluttered, approachable design, as seen in both Notion and Salesforce layouts.
Professional Polish: All components must have refined details including:
   - Subtle shadows and depth effects for buttons and cards (2-4px subtle drop shadows)
   - Smooth hover states and transitions (200-300ms ease transitions)
   - Precise spacing and alignment throughout all elements (8px grid system)
   - High-quality icons and illustrations (vector-based, consistent style)
   - Refined typography with appropriate line heights and letter spacing
   - Subtle animations for interactive elements that enhance user experience

Visual Sophistication: The UI should convey technological advancement through:
   - Clean, geometric shapes and forms
   - Precise alignment and visual hierarchy
   - Subtle gradients where appropriate (particularly in illustrations)
   - Deliberate use of negative space to create visual impact
   - Consistent visual language across all components
   - Integration of subtle motion design elements for key interactions
